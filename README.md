Python Automation Scripts : 

1) Duplicate File Removing :

This is a script in which I accepted directory name from CLI and travel through all Directories and Sub Directories.
And from that directories I delete all duplicate files whose Checksum is greater than one, and create one log file which contains 
list of deleted files which will be sent through GMAIL.
The first 'SIX' script are of Duplicate File Removing.
From 'Script1' to 'Script6'.

2) Running Process Identifier : 

In this script I accept directory name to create folder from CLI which generate one log file in it, which holds all informations of current running processes
in my machine and send it through GMAIL.
